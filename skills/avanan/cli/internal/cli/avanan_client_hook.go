// Installs Avanan request signing on every client the CLI constructs.
//
// Avanan's legacy scheme requires a freshly computed signature on every
// request, so it cannot be expressed as the static header set the spec's
// apiKey scheme produces. Registering a client hook applies the signing
// transport to generated endpoint commands and hand-written commands alike,
// without editing any generated file.
